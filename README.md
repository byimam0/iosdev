Once you input the car type like 2014 Ford mustang, it will have all the information needed to give you a clear walkthrough 
it will guide you through the parts and what you need to do and have 
like a jack, screw, bucket, etc. it'll help with oil changes, tire change. another feature is that it will tell you when 
you should get a oil change, and other mainatance.
