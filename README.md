## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The control drag didnt work for a little. 



App Brainstorming

RealApp - commenting on each player, real time stats, mutilpe leagues 

Chess.com - easy UI, the after match review, simple matchmaking 

Cronometer - free barcode scanning, goal setting, contant reminders 


App I would like to design is an app that walks you through doing mantinace on car. 
Once you input the car type like 2014 Ford mustang, it will have all the information needed to give you a clear walkthrough 
it will guide you through the parts and what you need to do and have 
like a jack, screw, bucket, etc. it'll help with oil changes, tire change. another feature is that it will tell you when 
you should get a oil change, and other mainatance.
